# ShareBnB

ShareBnB is a fullstack mock AirBnB clone website using a React frontend, Express backend, PostgresSQL database, and AWS S3 for photo uploads. Hosts can list open spaces such as their backyard or pool spaces for rent by other users.

ShareBnB allows users to sign-up or login. Authentication is implemented with Bcrypt and persists with JSON Web Tokens. Once logged in, users have access to the following features:

- view all current listings
- search for listings by location
- add a listing and upload their own photo
- send and receive private messages with other users
